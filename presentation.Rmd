## Introdution

In this assignment, I am going to create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly.

## Loading the data

In this assignment, I will use the Iris data set from the `datasets` package.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(iris)
```

Take a look at some first row in this data set:

```{r}
head(iris)
```

## Plotting

An interactive plot showing the correlation between the Sepal length and Petal length of each Iris species:

```{r}
library(plotly)
fig <- plot_ly(data = iris, x = ~Sepal.Length, y = ~Petal.Length, color = ~Species)
fig
```

## This is the end of the slides
